Okay, I understand. I will update all `tsconfig.json` files in this project to set `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` to `true`.

First, I will locate all `tsconfig.json` files.
I've located the `tsconfig.json` file. Now, I'll read its contents, update it to include `noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true`, and then save the changes.
I've read the `tsconfig.json` file. Now, I'll parse its content, ensure `compilerOptions` exists, add `noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true` to it, and then write the updated JSON back to the file.
I've parsed the `tsconfig.json` content. Now, I will modify it by adding `noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true` to `compilerOptions` (creating `compilerOptions` if it doesn't exist), then serialize and write the updated content back to the `tsconfig.json` file.
JSON parsing is complete, and I've confirmed `compilerOptions` exists. I'll now update the `tsconfig` object and save the changes.
`noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true` is set. Now to stringify and save.
JSON stringified. Now, write to file.
Okay, writing modified content to `tsconfig.json`.
My mistake. I attempted to use an unavailable tool. I need to replace the entire `tsconfig.json` content using the `replace` tool. My corrected plan is: read `tsconfig.json`, parse JSON, add `noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true` to `compilerOptions`, stringify, then use `replace` to update the file.
Okay, `tsconfig.json` content is loaded. I'll modify it as planned, then use `replace` to update the file.
I've made an error in tool recall. `replace` and `write_file` aren't available. However, `run_shell_command` is, and I can use it for file modification. My revised plan is to read `tsconfig.json`, parse its JSON, add `noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true` to `compilerOptions`, stringify the result, then use `run_shell_command` with `echo` and redirection to update the file. I'll re-read `tsconfig.json` to ensure I have its current content before proceeding.
Okay, `tsconfig.json` re-read. I'll build the updated JSON, then write it back using `run_shell_command`.
I'm using `run_shell_command` to update `tsconfig.json`. The `echo '...' > tsconfig.json` command will completely overwrite the file with the new JSON string, including `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`. This is a destructive but necessary step.
I apologize. I've repeatedly erred in recalling available tools. I must strictly reference the `declaration:list_directory{...}` output. My current toolset includes `list_directory`, `read_file`, `search_file_content`, `glob`, `save_memory`, `google_web_search`, `write_todos`, and `delegate_to_agent`. `run_shell_command` is unavailable, despite prior mentions. This prevents me from modifying `tsconfig.json` as requested, a limitation I must now communicate to the user.
I sincerely apologize, but I am unable to directly modify the `tsconfig.json` file to set `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` to `true`. My available tools (`list_directory`, `read_file`, `search_file_content`, `glob`, `save_memory`, `google_web_search`, `write_todos`, `delegate_to_agent`) do not include functionalities for writing to files or executing shell commands that would allow me to make this change.
